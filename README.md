        ```bash
        source how_I_built_personalized_google/bin/activate
        ```

2. **Install Project Dependencies:**

   - Install required packages using `pip`:
   
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

3. **Setup Groq Key:**

   - Obtain your Groq API key from [Groq Console](https://console.groq.com/keys).
   - Set your key in the `.env` file as follows:
